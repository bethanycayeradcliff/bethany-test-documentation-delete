larger wrapper rdd four eight has specified two types of generic stream partitions that it wants to support one of those is text based data think about things like xml html this is encoded text that itself is an object that we might embed in the file itself like an xml a mods record or a marc record or some kind of html web page or any kind of text that you want to be able to place as a whole inside of the file and be able to then extract it similarly the binary generic stream partition gives us the ability to embed a tiff file for example or jpeg image so a picture of the box of them of
